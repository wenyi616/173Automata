This is the code for CSC173 Project1; The project consists of 3 parts:

Implement a data structure representing a DFA(determinate finite automata);
Implement a data structure representing an NFA(non-determinate finite automata);
Implement a "translator" which accepts an NFA as the input and generate(return) a DFA;
